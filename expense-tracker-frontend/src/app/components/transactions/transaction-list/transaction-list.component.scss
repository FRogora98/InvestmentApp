/* Base styles for consistency with the new design system */

/* No need for additional styles since we're using inline styles in the component template */
/* This ensures that the styling is driven by CSS variables and shared utility classes */

/* If you need to add component-specific styles that aren't covered by the global styles,
   add them here. For now, we're keeping the file for future styling needs. */
